# Mod5-CSS-Tutorial

My artical for this assignment is at the following website: https://css-tricks.com/using-css-cursors/

Article Learnings:
This article reviewed the different types of cursors that are available in CSS.  It provided examples of the cursor property and the many interesting value options (wait, crosshair, cell, alias, etc.).  Sample code was provided and opoerated properly for me in testing.  It also introduced me to the idea of using JavaScript in conjunction with the CSS in live-example form, which was not the focus of the article but rather a neat takeaway.    

Article Evaluation:
The sequence of ideas in the article was quite clear, beginning with the limitations of the more-typically-used default cursor states.  The author explained that although we are familiar with basic hypertext cursor changes, among others, this property alteration is not extensively used.  The possibilities were then demonstrated through a window that changes your cursor state as you hover over the different CSS value options.  Sample code was provided in order to give the user an example for testing.  Finally, a few more advanced topics that bridge into the JavaScript realm were discussed at a high level.


The example windows that responded in real-time to the user clearly demonstrated the concept and were the most compelling components of the article for me.  Additionally, the sequence of ideas was easy to follow, and the basic code example worked when tested.  Sometimes very focused articles like this tend to argue an extreme case out of an optional ("nice-to-have") detail.  Some of that did exist in the article, but this minor salesmanship point should not be allowed to overshadow the author's greater efforts.
